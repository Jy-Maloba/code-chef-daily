# Chef has two integers XX and YY. Chef wants to perform some operations to make XX and YY equal. In one operation, Chef can either:

# set X := X + 1X:=X+1
# or set Y := Y + 2Y:=Y+2
# Find the minimum number of operations required to make XX and YY equal.

# Input Format
# The first line contains a single integer TT â€” the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
# The first and only line of each test case contains two space separated integers XX and YY.
# Output Format
# For each test case, print the minimum number of operations required to make XX and YY equal.
