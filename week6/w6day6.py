# Problem
# Chef's professor is planning to give his class a group assignment. 
# There are 2N2N students in the class, with distinct roll numbers ranging from 11 to 2N2N. 
# Chef's roll number is XX.

# The professor decided to create NN groups of 22 students each. 
# The groups were created as follows: the first group consists of roll numbers 11 and 2N2N, 
# the second group of roll numbers 22 and 2N - 12Nâˆ’1, and so on, with the final group consisting of roll numbers NN and N+1N+1.

# Chef wonders who his partner will be. Can you help Chef by telling him the roll number of his partner?
